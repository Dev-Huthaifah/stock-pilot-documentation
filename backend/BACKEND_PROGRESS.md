# Backend Progress and Handoff

## Stack
ASP.NET Core Web API, C#/.NET 10, EF Core 10, SQL Server; LocalDB for local development.

## Paths
- Solution: `StockPilot.slnx`
- API: `src/StockPilot.Api/StockPilot.Api.csproj`
- DbContext: `src/StockPilot.Api/Data/StockPilotDbContext.cs`
- Models: `src/StockPilot.Api/Models/`
- Migrations: `src/StockPilot.Api/Migrations/`

## Implemented

### Persistence
Seven core entities exist: Company, Warehouse, Product, ProductStock, StockMovement, StockTransfer, StockTransferItem. DbContext configures relationships, company-scoped composite keys/foreign keys, indexes, and check constraints. ProductStock.RowVersion is configured as a row-version concurrency token.

Migrations `InitialCreate` and `AddProductPriceConstraints` were reported applied locally. The database health endpoint previously returned `{"status":"Connected"}`.

### Company management
Files:
- `DTOs/Companies/CreateCompanyDto.cs`
- `DTOs/Companies/UpdateCompanyDto.cs`
- `DTOs/Companies/CompanyResponseDto.cs`
- `Services/Interfaces/ICompanyService.cs`
- `Services/Implementations/CompanyService.cs`
- `Controllers/CompaniesController.cs`

Operations: create, get by ID, list, update, deactivate. Route base: `/api/platform/companies`. Company deactivation sets `IsActive=false`. The service is registered in Program.cs.

**Important:** `Company.Id` is `Guid`, not `int`. Use Guid consistently for company IDs.

### Warehouse management
Files:
- `DTOs/Warehouses/CreateWarehouseDto.cs`
- `DTOs/Warehouses/UpdateWarehouseDto.cs`
- `DTOs/Warehouses/WarehouseResponseDto.cs`
- `Services/Interfaces/IWarehouseService.cs`
- `Services/Implementations/WarehouseService.cs`
- `Controllers/WarehousesController.cs`

The service is registered in `Program.cs`. No migration was required; the Warehouse entity and its database configuration already existed.

Route base: `/api/companies/{companyId}/warehouses`

Implemented operations:
- `POST /` — create a warehouse for an active company.
- `GET /` — list warehouses scoped by CompanyId.
- `GET /{warehouseId}` — retrieve a warehouse scoped by CompanyId and warehouse ID.
- `PUT /{warehouseId}` — update name, code, and address.
- `DELETE /{warehouseId}` — soft-deactivate by setting `IsActive=false`; returns `204 No Content`.

Warehouse codes are checked for duplicates within the company, and the database's unique company/code index remains the final integrity constraint. DTO validation includes required name/code and maximum lengths. Names and codes are trimmed; blank addresses are normalized to null.

**Tenant isolation note:** CompanyId is currently supplied explicitly in the route for early development and testing. It is a scoping parameter, not proof of identity or authorization. Production requests must derive the tenant from a trusted authenticated server-side context.

## Last known validation
- `dotnet build StockPilot.slnx` succeeded after implementing Warehouse Management.
- API was tested locally at `http://localhost:5130`.
- Manual PowerShell API tests succeeded for warehouse create, list, get by ID, update, and deactivate.
- A follow-up GET confirmed the deactivated warehouse remains retrievable with `IsActive=false`. This is the current soft-delete behavior; GET endpoints do not currently filter inactive warehouses.
- These were manual API integration checks; automated unit/integration test coverage has not been confirmed.
- Verify the current API configuration and database state before relying on the local environment.

## Recent commits
- `7ef199b` — `implement warehouse management CRUD`
- `71e7c12` — `implement company management service`
- `ef95fd6` — `finalize inventory data model and constraints`

At the time of this update, commit `7ef199b` is present on `origin/main`. Re-check local state when continuing:
```powershell
git status --short
git log -5 --oneline
git remote -v
```

## Known unfinished work / limitations
- Company and warehouse endpoints are not yet protected by authentication/authorization; do not expose publicly in production.
- Platform Admin identity/authorization is not implemented.
- Main Moderator invitation/account setup is not implemented.
- Company membership, roles, and permissions are not implemented.
- Trusted server-side tenant resolution is pending.
- Validation and consistent error handling need strengthening.
- Product, Stock, Movement, and Transfer services/controllers are not yet implemented.
- Full transaction/concurrency handling for stock posting is pending.
- Automated unit/integration tests have not been confirmed.

## Next backend tasks
1. Implement Product DTOs, service interface, service implementation, and controller, following the established pattern.
2. Scope every product operation by CompanyId; retain the same tenant-isolation caveat until authenticated tenant context exists.
3. Implement Product Stock management and inventory movements.
4. Implement atomic multi-item stock transfer posting with appropriate transaction and concurrency handling.
5. Design Authentication, Platform Admin, company membership, Main Moderator, roles, and permissions.
6. Add validation, consistent error handling, automated tests, and authorization.

## Next-session instruction
Inspect the actual repository state first. Review the Product entity, `StockPilotDbContext` product configuration, existing Company and Warehouse service/controller patterns, and current migrations. Then implement Product Management without duplicating or contradicting the existing entity and database constraints.
